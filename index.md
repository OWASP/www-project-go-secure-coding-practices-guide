approach".

## Description

According to Stack Overflowâ€™s annual Developer Survey, Go has made the top 5
most Loved and Wanted programming languages list for the second year in a row.
With its surge in popularity, it is critical that applications developed in Go
are designed with security in mind.

The primary audience of the Go Secure Coding Practices Guide is developers,
particularly the ones with previous experience with other programming languages.

The book is also a great reference to those learning programming for the first
time, who have already finish the [Go tour][0].

topic-by-topic, providing examples and recommendations using Go, to help

After reading this book, you'll be more confident you're developing secure Go
applications.
